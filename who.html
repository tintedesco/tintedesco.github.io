		<p><h1>meet the bride</h1>
		Stephanie Tin (an ode to her inner beauty without mention of how she’s always late to things, by Luke Tedesco)</p>

<p>When my mom first asked me to tell her about Stephanie – back in the Summer of 2012 – I told her that she is loud and eats a lot. This continues to be an apt description of her.</p>

<p>Stephanie is the technically-metaphorical-but-very-nearly-literal mother to two beautiful groups of children that she met at Brown and WashU. She’s a beautiful, kind, caring soul who cares deeply about her friends and would do anything to bring us all together. This includes wanting to host as many friends as possible in a single house for our wedding.</p>

<p>For those of you who haven’t had the honor and privilege of meeting her, please look forward to her bubbly personality and warm smile lighting up any room she’s in and her delightful laugh echoing during the weekend. I’m excited for you to meet my ex-girlfriend / soon-to-be first wife, and I’m sure you’ll quickly see why I love her.</p>

		<p><h1>
			meet the groom</h1>

			Luke Tedesco: Aquarius, Gryffindor, Air Nomad, ENTP (also, part Filipino and a Boston sports fan, for my family reading back home)</p>

<p>Luke is so happy! Easygoing and easily amused. He loves games of all kinds and he champions silly traditions. He likes what he likes and he doesn’t care what you think about it- Like, going to bed early *and* sleeping in late. Making drinks with weird ingredients but hating foods with normal condiments. Listening to his entire library on shuffle. Wearing sweatpants in business class.</p>

<p>Luke is clever and inquisitive, ambitious and driven. He’s first to help out- sometimes out of kindness, sometimes out of overconfidence, but he always helps. He’s genuine, and sharp, and funny... I think Luke can do anything.

		</p>
		<p><h1>
			our love story</h1>

			Steph and Luke met, and then dated, and then decided to get married. Let’s see how it goes.

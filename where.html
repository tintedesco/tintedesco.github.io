		<h1>wedding places</h1>

		<h1>area recommendations</h1>
		<div class="headerinfo">St. Louis is a fascinating place. If you have time before or after the wedding, we hope you’ll stick around to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mv8vDRJDFjgbDqGT8" target="_blank">explore</a>!</div>

		<h2>our favorites</h2>
		
		<p><h3>The Arch</h3><br>
		The Gateway to the West. A national park! The grounds are brand new. You can ride to the top.* There’s a history exhibit on site and across the street at the Dred Scott courthouse. It’s really impressive in person.
		<br>*Not for the claustrophobic or faint of heart. Yes, it's open post-COVID. <a href="https://tickets.gatewayarch.com/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=cat&c=GARTKT" target="_blank">Book tickets here.</a></p>

		<p><h3>City Museum</h3><br>
		Imagine an old office building, with the floors gutted, and a maze/playground/jungle gym of sculptures in their place. No maps and no restrictions. We find something new every time we go. Luke’s favorite is the skateless indoor skate park. Stephanie’s is the school bus perched off the roof. Crowd favorite is the ten-story slide. Meant for all ages with three bars inside and late night hours on weekends. This is one of those places that is very uniquely St. Louis. Please go! (But not during the day- swarms of children.)</p>

		<p><h3>The Fountain on Locust</h3><br>
		A 50s style diner with 20s style decor. They make homey soups and sandwiches, but we go for the ice cream sundaes and ice cream cocktails. A casual sit-down spot with eclectic waitstaff and patrons. This place has character.</p>

		<p><h3>Blood & Sand</h3><br>
		A fancy underground cocktail bar that opened to non-members a few years ago. The cocktails are unusual *and* taste good!</p>

		<p><h3>Mission Taco</h3><br>
		Really varied tacos that you order by the each. We could probably recite our orders to you from memory, drinks and appetizers included. Tequila shots are $2 after 10 PM..!</p>

		<h2>also notable</h2>
		<p><h3>Salt + Smoke</h3><br>
		St. Louis barbecue in a whiskey bar-meets-white tablecloths kind of place. Luke’s favorite side is the mac and cheese; Stephanie’s is the green beans; Josh’s is the popovers.</p>

		<p><h3>Forest Park</h3><br>
		Bigger than Central Park! Houses three museums, two golf courses, a greenhouse, a skating rink, and the 1904 World’s Fair Pavilion. Free admission almost everywhere. For lounging, we recommend Art Hill, the green outside the art museum overlooking a fountain the size of a pond. For something more active, we like the St. Louis Zoo, voted the best in the country at some point, we’re told. And the park itself is nice too.</p>

		<p><h3>Anheuser-Busch*</h3><br>
		Home of Budweiser and the Clydesdales and all their other mascots, too. There’s a beer garden on site and free tours as well as paid ones. Big campus and some beautiful buildings. Plan to be on your feet for at least half an hour. Please ask the tour guide why they need so many Clydesdales – all they would tell us is “they’re there for backup.” (???)
		<br>As of April 2021 Anheuser-Busch is still closed for COVID, but we anticipate they'll be open and bustling by August.</p>

		<p><h3>The Cardinals</h3><br>
		The Cardinals have a home game on August 8th. The stadium is structured so you can watch the sun set behind the Arch! There's also Ballpark Village across the street- a big complex of bars and restaurants centered around an indoor beer garden.</p>

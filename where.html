		St. Louis is a fascinating place. If you have time before or after the wedding weekend, we hope you’ll stick around to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mv8vDRJDFjgbDqGT8" target="_blank">explore</a>!

		<h1>our favorites</h1>
		<p><h3>The Arch</h3><br>
		The Gateway to the West. A national park! The grounds are brand new. You can ride to the top.* There’s a history exhibit on site and across the street at the Dred Scott courthouse. It’s really impressive in person.
		<br>*Not for the claustrophobic or faint of heart. <a href="https://tickets.gatewayarch.com/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=cat&c=GARTKT" target="_blank">Book tickets in advance here.</a></p>

		<p><h3>City Museum</h3><br>
		Imagine an old office building, with the floors gutted, and a maze/playground/jungle gym of sculptures in their place. No maps and no restrictions. We find something new every time we go. Luke’s favorite is the skateless indoor skate park. Stephanie’s is the school bus perched off the roof. Crowd favorite is the ten-story slide. Meant for all ages with three bars inside and late night hours on weekends. This is one of those places that is very uniquely St. Louis. Please go! (But not during the day- swarms of children.)</p>

		<p><h3>The Fountain on Locust</h3><br>
		A 50s style diner with 20s style decor. They make homey soups and sandwiches, but we go for the ice cream sundaes and ice cream cocktails. A casual sit-down spot with eclectic waitstaff and patrons. This place has character.</p>

		<h1>also notable</h1>
		<p><h3>Salt + Smoke</h3><br>
		St. Louis barbecue in a whiskey bar-meets-white tablecloths kind of place. Luke’s favorite side is the mac and cheese; Stephanie’s is the green beans; Josh’s is the popovers.</p>

		<p><h3>Forest Park</h3><br>
		Bigger than Central Park! Houses three museums, two golf courses, a greenhouse, a skating rink, and the 1904 World’s Fair Pavilion. Free admission almost everywhere. For lounging, we recommend Art Hill, the green outside the art museum overlooking a fountain the size of a pond. For something more active, we like the St. Louis Zoo, voted the best in the country at some point, we’re told. And the park itself is nice too.</p>

		<p><h3>Anheuser-Busch</h3><br>
		Home of Budweiser and the Clydesdales and all their other mascots, too. There’s a beer garden on site and free tours as well as paid ones. Big campus and some beautiful buildings. Plan to be on your feet for at least half an hour. Please ask the tour guide why they need so many Clydesdales – all they would tell us is “they’re there for backup.” (???)</p>

		<p><h3>The Cardinals</h3><br>
		The stadium is structured so you can watch the sun set behind the Arch. Next season’s schedule isn’t out yet, but if there aren’t any home games the week of the wedding, there’s always Ballpark Village across the street- a big complex of bars and restaurants centered around an indoor beer garden.</p>

		<p><h3>Talanya’s</h3><br>
		A strip club turned night club complete with disco balls, mirrored walls, and $4 drinks. It’s a last-stop-of-the-night type of place. Can get sloppy; don’t go alone.</p>

		<h1>what to do in washington</h1>

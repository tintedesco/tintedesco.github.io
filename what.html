		<h1>logistics</h1><div class="headerinfo">and frequently asked questions</div>
		<p>
		<h2>are you married?</h2>
		<p>Technically, yes. We had a small ceremony with a virtual audience (but real paperwork) last year. This year we'll be doing a renewal of vows.<br><br></p>
		<h2>what about covid?</h2>
		<p>We are vaccinated! And we hope you are too. We have high-risk family members who will be attending, and we ask that you respect their safety by protecting yourself.<br><br></p>
		<h2>travel</h2>
		<p>The nearest airport is St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL). All of the wedding activities will be in the city of Washington, which is about an hour's drive from the airport. There is no public transportation between the two. We recommend getting a rental car. (Free parking is available at all of the wedding locations.)<br><br></p>
		<h2>attire</h2>
		<p>We request formal attire for the wedding day. Long dresses and jackets with ties would be appropriate.<br><br></p>
		<h2>children</h2>
		<p>We respectfully request that little ones stay home. We love your kids! (Stephanie loves the human ones and Luke loves the four-legged ones.) But we think it's in their best interests to sit this one out.<br><br></p>
		<h2>field day</h2>
		<p>The extended wedding party is invited to arrive a day early for lawn games, drinking games, and sporting competitions. This event is not suitable for children. If you'll be in town and would like to join us, please let us know!<br><br></p>
		<h2>social media</h2>
		<p>Please send us any photos you take! We want them all. (Okay, Stephanie wants them all.) We're not hashtag-inclined, and the concept seems a bit outdated now, but Luke does love puns and we already crowdsourced these, so feel free to use them or try and outdo them:
		<br>#lukestephsitup (when appropriate, #lukeseffeditup)
		<br>#lukeiamyourwife then #nooothatstinpossible!

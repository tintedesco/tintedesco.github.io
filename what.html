		<p>
		<h2>travel</h2>
		<p>The nearest airport is St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL). If you're traveling from Boston, Southwest is the only airline with nonstop flights.<br>All of the weekend's activities will take place in the city of Washington, which is about an hour's drive from the airport. There is no public transportation between the two. We recommend getting a rental car. (Free parking is available at all of the wedding weekend locations.)<br><br></p>
		<h2>attire</h2>
		<p>We request formal attire for Saturday’s events. Jackets/ties and long dresses would be appropriate.<br><br></p>
		<h2>children</h2>
		<p>We respectfully request that little ones stay home. We love your kids! (Stephanie loves the human ones and Luke loves the four-legged ones.) But we think it's in their best interests to sit this one out.<br><br></p>
		<h2>field day</h2>
		<p>The extended wedding party is invited to arrive a day early for lawn games, drinking games, and sporting competitions. This event is not suitable for children. If you will be in town but did not receive information about this event, please let us know!</p>
